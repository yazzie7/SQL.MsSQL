# Business Intelligence Lab Homework - BME University

This repository contains the homework project for the Business Intelligence lab at **BME University**. The project involves working with **Microsoft SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Visual Studio** to solve business intelligence problems and perform data analysis.

**Project Documentation and Detailed Instructions:**  
For more details on the lab and project requirements, visit the [Business Intelligence Lab Documentation](https://bi-labor.github.io/es-mssql/mssql/).

## Overview

The main objective of this homework is to demonstrate how to:

- Utilize **Microsoft SQL** for data extraction and querying.
- Visualize data using **Power BI** to derive actionable insights.
- Integrate and manage data sources using **Visual Studio**.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Used for database creation, data manipulation, and complex queries.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive data visualizations and reports.
- **Visual Studio**: Used for managing the project, writing SQL scripts, and integrating data sources.

## Project Structure

- **SQL Queries**: Contains SQL scripts for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Power BI Reports**: Contains Power BI files for visualizing the data in an interactive manner.
- **Visual Studio Project**: Contains the project setup for integrating SQL and Power BI with a basic data model.

## Steps to Run

### 1. Microsoft SQL Setup
- Install **Microsoft SQL Server** (if not already installed).
- Set up the database using the provided **SQL scripts**. Ensure all tables and relationships are created as per the project requirements.
- Run the SQL queries in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to populate and query the database.

### 2. Power BI Report
- Open the provided **Power BI (.pbix)** file.
- Connect Power BI to the **Microsoft SQL** database by configuring the data source.
- Update or refresh the data model as necessary to reflect the changes made in the SQL database.
- Customize the visualizations as per the project guidelines and requirements.

### 3. Visual Studio Setup
- Open the provided **Visual Studio** solution.
- Make sure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.
- Use Visual Studio to write, test, and execute SQL queries to retrieve data for the Power BI reports.
- Integrate SQL queries with Power BI for dynamic data loading.

## Objectives

- To practice querying and manipulating data using **SQL**.
- To visualize data in **Power BI** through charts, tables, and other visual components.
- To use **Visual Studio** for managing and integrating the project files effectively.
